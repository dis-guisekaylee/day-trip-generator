# Day Trip Generator

The Day Trip Generator project is my first project assigned at devCodeCamp.

Currently, it generates a random location in southeast/central Wisconsin ideal for a day trip.

In the future, it will also generate random, corresponding restaurants, methods of transportation, and attractions.

The goal for this app is to efficiently create varying itineraries until the user is satisfied with one.
